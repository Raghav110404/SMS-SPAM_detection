# Sms_Spam_Classifier
This project is an SMS Spam Detection System that classifies incoming text messages as either Spam (unwanted/advertisement/fraud messages) or Ham (legitimate messages).
With the rapid increase of unsolicited SMS, such a system helps improve user safety and prevent fraud by automatically filtering out spam content.

The project is built using Python and leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to process raw SMS data, clean it, extract meaningful patterns, and classify messages with high accuracy.
 Objectives
To preprocess and clean SMS text data for analysis.

To apply NLP techniques to convert text into numerical features.

To train machine learning models for classifying SMS messages as Spam or Ham.

To evaluate and compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To provide an efficient, reliable, and easy-to-use spam filtering solution.

The dataset used for this project is the famous SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
